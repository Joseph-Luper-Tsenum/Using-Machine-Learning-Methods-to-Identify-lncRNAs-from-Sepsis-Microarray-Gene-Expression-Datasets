### Using Machine Learning Methods to Identify lncRNAs from Sepsis Microarray Gene Expression Datasets

Abstract

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Early diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and improved outcomes. Increasing evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles as potential biomarkers in a wide range of human diseases, including sepsis. However, identifying reliable lncRNA biomarkers remains a difficult task, particularly due to challenges in feature selection and the imbalance of small datasets. In recent years, machine learning approaches have been successfully applied to microarray data in predictive genomic studies. In this study, we trained binary classification models to identify lncRNAs as potential biomarkers for sepsis. Among the models tested, XGBoost achieved the best performance, with an AUC of 0.97. Based on the predictive power of XGBoost, we identified 10 candidate lncRNA biomarkers for sepsis: WDFY3-AS2, NFE4, WDR11-AS1, TP53TG1, ZNF790-AS1, ANKRD10-IT1, LINC01352, CHRM3-AS2, LINC00528, and FAM13A-AS1.
